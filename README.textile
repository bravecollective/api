h2(#what-is). %1.% What are the Core Service API Bindings?

There are three primary components provided by this package:

* A method of generating keys in the correct format.
* Client API bindings.
* WebCore Controller sub-class which implements the server-side API.


h2(#installation). %2.% Installation

Development takes place on "GitHub":github in the "core":github-project project.  Issue tracking, documentation, and downloads are provided there.

Installing the current development version of the API Bindings requires "Git":git, a distributed source code management system.  In Debian/Ubuntu, these are found in packages `python-dev`.

Run the following to download the development version with Git, and _link_ it into your Python runtime:

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/bravecollective/api.git
(cd api; python setup.py develop)</code></pre>

You can upgrade to the latest version at any time:

<pre><code>(cd api; git pull; python setup.py develop)</code></pre>

If you would like to make changes and contribute them back to the project, fork the GitHub project, make your changes, and submit a pull request.  This process is beyond the scope of this documentation; for more information, see "GitHub's documentation":github-help.
